## Project

In this project I wrote the JavaScript that powers my own online resume.

This project is meant to be completed while taking the JavaScript Basics course. 
Throughout the course I built my resume by writing a JS script that combined my personal information with pre-written HTML and CSS templates to generate my resume.
